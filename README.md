## Description
Dresscode (temporary name) is a digital, AI-powered wardrobe organizer designed to designed to extend
the lifespan of users' existing clothing through intelligent outfit generation. Our mission combats
fast fashion waste by helping users rediscover wearable value in their current wardrobe inventory.
As part of our academic entrepreneurship program's capstone project, we're developing this solution
to address the environmental impact of underutilized clothing (estimated 87% of materials and fibers
used for clothes ends up in landfills - [TheRoundup.org](https://theroundup.org/sustainable-fashion-statistics/))
and optimize the time spent looking for the perfect outfit everyday.

## MVP features
The MVP will consist of simple wardrobe organizer with which users will be able to create their digital
wardrobe and manually create and save outfits within the app. This version will first be released on
the stores (Play Store and App Store) before we continue iterating. The next versions features will be
detailed in our [Roadmap](Roadmap.md)
